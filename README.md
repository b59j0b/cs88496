Economics 4160 
Urban and Regional Economics 
Winter 2025 
COURSE DESCRIPTION 
This seminar-style. course introduces students to urban and regional   economics topics,   including urbanization, local labour and housing market, transportation, pollution, urban poverty, crime, and fiscal matters. Throughout the semester, we will learn canonical urban and   regional   economics models and concepts and read and discuss contemporary   empirical research   in urban   and regional   economics. Through a series of   lectures, presentations, and class   discussions, the   course   aims to develop the skills to apply economics to urban policy problems, communicate economic   ideas   and   research findings, and conduct independent research. 
LEARNING OUTCOMES 
Upon   successful   completion   of   the   course, the   student   will   be   able   to
•       understand   how   to   work   with   and   apply   foundational   models   in   urban   economics
•         understand   empirical   tools   in   urban   economics
•         work with spatial data   and maps
•       understand,   synthesize,   and   criticize   academic   literature   on   urban   policy   issues
•         communicate economic ideas and research findings
•       understand   the   components   and   process   of   independent   research
PREREQUISITES The minimum requirement is ECON-1100. However, more advanced level   microeconomics   courses   (e.g., ECON-2210), a   basic   understanding of   calculus, and   knowledge about statistics or econometrics   will be great assets in this   course.

EMAILS 
Please always be courteous and respectful in your email correspondence.
I reply to emails on weekdays within 48 hours if they require a response.   (For   example,   an   email informing me that a student will miss a class does not   require   a   response.)   Emails   received   over   the   weekend generally will not be replied to until   Sunday evening or Monday morning. 
Before emailing me, please check the syllabus, recent emails from me,   and   announcements posted   on Brightspace to see if   the information you are looking   for   is provided there—it   often   is!
Email is not a substitute for office hours. If   you have   a   question   about   the   material,   it   is best   to   come to my office hours or ask me during   or   after   class.
Please do not wait to email a question about the   exam,   an   assignment,   or   a   class   just before these   things   occur. If   you   do, chances   are   your   question   will   go   unanswered.
REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING 
Grading 
Your final grade (letter) will be based on the following   scale:
% range Letter grade 90-100 A+ 85-89.9 A 80-84.9 A- 77-79.9 B+ 
% range Letter grade 73-76.9 B 70-72.9 B- 67-69.9 C+ 63-66.9 C % range Letter grade 60-62.9 C- 57-59.9 D+ 53-56.9 D 50-52.9 D- 0-49.9 F 
This will be determined using the following scheme:Assessment Date and time Weight Class participation

Attendance and Participation Students are expected to attend all classes. Class participation   is   a vital part   of   learning. Students are strongly encouraged to ask questions during class. Asking questions may have   positive ext代 写Economics 4160 Urban and Regional Economics Winter 2025C/C++

Participation grades will be assigned for two reflection articles (300-500 words each) on two papers assigned by the instructor, due at the beginning of the lectures in which we will discuss the articles.
Assignments 
There will be three graded assignments, each worth 5% of   the grade. The tentative deadlines for each   assignment are listed above and will be announced on the   course’s   website   on   Brightspace.Students   are   encouraged to   discuss   assignment problems with   classmates, but   each must   write   their own   answers   for   submission. Plagiarism   of   assignment   answers   will   be   considered   a   violation   of   the Academic   Integrity,   laid   out   in   the   Student   Code   of Conduct   and   will   result   in   zero   scores   for   all   parties involved.Students are expected to present their solutions in class and answer questions from the audience and the instructor. During these discussions, we’ll randomly select students to share parts of their answers and thoughts with the class.   We   do   random   selection   instead   of asking   for   volunteers,   as   it   helps   engage everyone.
Lab Assignment, Paper Presentation, and Term Paper Students work in groups of up to three for these three assessments. An anonymous peer evaluation method will be adopted in conjunction with instructor evaluation to mitigate the   free-rider problem   in group collaborations.
Lab Assignment. Each group will use data to analyze the economic geography   of   a   city   in   Canada   or   replicate   the   analytical   portion   of   an   academic   paper.Term Paper. Each group can submit a policy   briefing, research proposal,   or   literature   survey   on   a   topic of   their choice in urban economics. The submission   should be between 2000-3000 words   (8-   12 pages   double-spaced).
•         A policy briefing summarizes   and   distills   what   is   known   about   the   topic   to   inform.	
policymakers. This means picking a specific context or   jurisdiction and   describing   the policy landscape and issues. You will then apply urban economic theories   and   evidence to   critically evaluate existing policies and propose new and improved policies where appropriate.
•         A research proposal identifies   the   gap   or   an   unanswered   question   in   the   literature   and
proposes a novel analysis to fill the gap or   answer the   question. A proposal   should thus describe a hypothesis, the relevant theory, data, and methods you plan to apply or use.   You   do not need to complete the proposed analysis, but making some progress is useful and helps demonstrate the proposed project's feasibility.
•         A literature survey is a deep dive into the literature   on   a particular topic   with   the   goal   of providing   the   readers   with   a   comprehensive   review   of   the   topic. Literature   surveys   are opinionated and offer a critical summary   of   the   existing research.
You will select your topic and submit a 300   to   500-word preliminary report   worth   2%   of   your   final   grade by   11:59 PM on Friday, February 7. This preliminary report will briefly describe the   topic you intend to study and whether you will write a policy briefing, research proposal, or   literature   survey. This will allow me to provide feedback early in the process. 
You will then work continuously on the term paper and submit   a   500 to   800-word progress report   worth 3% of   your final grade by   11:59 PM on Friday,   March   14.   This progress   report   should describe at least one of   the following: a   concept   or model   from   class that   is   important   for your paper, a challenge you have encountered and a   strategy   for overcoming   it,   or   an   important   task you have completed so far. You should also   conclude your progress report with   your plans   for   proceeding. 
Paper Presentation. Each group will select an article to present   from   a provided   list.   Presentations   will be approximately 20 minutes long, followed by a   10-minute QA.   Each presentation   should summarize the chosen article, focusing on the results and policy   implications. A   detailed   schedule   will be available on Brightspace.
